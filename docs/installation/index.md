# Installation

Get your Hytale server running in Docker with these guides.

The recommended approach is using **Docker Compose** for easier management, but you can also use plain Docker commands.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Docker** installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
2. **A Hytale account** with game access
3. **4GB+ RAM** available for the server

## Installation Methods

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| [Docker Compose](docker-compose.html) | Production servers, easy management |
| [Docker CLI](docker-cli.html) | Quick testing, simple setups |

## Next Steps

After installation, you'll need to:

1. [Authenticate the server](authentication.html) with your Hytale account
2. [Configure server settings](../configuration/) to customize your server
